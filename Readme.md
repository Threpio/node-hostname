## Process Taken so far

Created Dockerfile for nodejs

Created AKS and acr terraform and started it as it takes ages to provision

Created ACR push script and code

Ensured docker file container works locally.

sorted out helm shizzle

--platform linux/amd64 lol

I have spent about 30 minutes pruning images and sorting out the architectural differences - there goes my chance at the CI/CD part
 
Updated Workflow

## TO DO 

Secure Infrastructure - aks api etc

Node module bundling and cleanup? I think atm it is only enforcing and placing a dev build into production
